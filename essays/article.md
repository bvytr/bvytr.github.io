## Article Reaction and Takeaway

I have always been grateful to the open-source community and the Power to the People concept. Not only is this method of operation and thinking beneficial to the majority, but it also ensures that there will always be resources available for those wanting to get started with programming. 

After reading the article, I was disappointed with npm's decision to side with Kik rather than Koçulu. As an enterprise with a mission to foster open-source JavaScript development, you would think that npm is on the side of programmers who contribute to their cause. However, seeing how they handled the situation between Kik, specically Bob Stratton and Koçulu, it became clear the strong hold that capitalist tendencies have on organizations. Although others may disagree, I believe that Koçulu had every right to remove his contributions from npm's library, and what resulted should have been a wake up call for npm and all other companies who are hindering innovation and sharing under the guise of patents. 

Seeing how easy it is to add and remove open-source code from softwares, open-source contributors like Koçulu should be given priority over corporations who have nothing but dollar bills in their eyes. Maybe if it were a different situation where Koçulu was not a self-taught programmer who relied on npm in his beginnings and later became a contributor, then I could somehow see that npm was correct in their decision. But for them to be jeopardizing their services by firstly, underestimating Koçulu's contributions and the 11 lines of code that broke the Internet, and secondly, going against their mission, demonstrates poor judgement on their part. On the matters of the Twitter hypothetical, why did npm not look further into how many people depended on Koçulu's contributions? If that was one of the factors that they would look into if it were Twitter and a twitter module, why did they not follow protocols with Kik and Koçulu? It was also ironic for the chief techology officer of npm to be talking about putting the needs of many over the wishes of one author, when they are, again, an open-source software that sided with a corporation who threatened an open-source contributor. 

This not only shows how open-source software thrives on the many contributions of programmers around the world, but also how this aspect is where its downfall lies. In the end, I believe that open-source software should be better monitored and that there should be protection for contributing programmers against patents and, most of all, threats from corporations.
