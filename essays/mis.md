*Like many others, I entered university without knowing what I wanted to major in.*

During high school, on my application to UH Manoa, I declared myself as a Fine Arts major. All that interested me during my twelve years of school was graphite on paper. Then, upon taking ICS 101 in my first semester and getting the opportunity to assist as an ATA in my second semester, I decided to pursue my interest in art and web design by majoring in MIS and Marketing. 

At my level of interest in mathematics, MIS was also a safer route than ICS and marketing was, in my opinion, a profitable art-related major. MIS, in combination with Marketing, would provide me with a wider range of careers from within the business, technology, and creative fields. The overlapping components of both majors will hopefully allow me to be more flexible and their combined skillsets will give me a greater advantage in whichever field I gravitate towards. 

In the beginning of my deciding to major in MIS, I had to explain to my parents what MIS was. However, I believe that its definition was lost in translation from English to Vietnamese because at the end of the explanation, I was designated as the in-house IT person. Although it was nice to be the techie of my family for the past few months, all that I have proved so far is that I am able to reboot my router (through an app provided in the manual) and unplug and replug wires. Hopefully, throughout the upcoming semesters, I can learn more about my major before my parents ask me to solve more advance problems.
