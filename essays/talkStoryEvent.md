## My Takeaway

On October 11, I attended the Talk Story with Tech Professionals event hosted by the Pacific Asian Center for Entrepeneurship. This event was an opportunity for students from all majors to meet and talk with over 20 professionals working in major and local tech companies. Since this was my first ever networking event, I was nervous and a bit overwhelmed amidst the crowd of students, some of which were my ITM 352 classmates, professionals, and UH faculty. However, by the end of the evening, I developed dozens of questions and became eager to start learning more about working in the professional tech field and how I can make the most of my remaining years at UH Manoa.

Even though we were supposed to rotate around the area to speak with different professionals, I found myself stuck in the same place talking to Mirabela Medallon for two and a half rounds. Unlike the many seasoned professionals in the speaker panel, Mirabela is a recent UH graduate with a B.S. in Computer Science who is currently working as a full stack developer and designer at Booz Allen Hamilton. As a student who was an ex-art major and a front-end enthusiast, I was excited to hear that Mirabela used her background in art, graphic design in particular, to enter the tech world. When I voiced my desire to enter the tech field with an art background and told her of my concern over my lack of experience in back-end developing, Mirabela easily eased by worries. She told me how art can become a strong asset that employers looks for and how I can always gain experience along the way. I was encouraged to strengthen my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge, as well as learn the React.js framework, and take up on back-end languages like Python, Node.js, and Express. After speaking to and exchanging emails with Mirabela, I am excited to start building my portfolio, both art and programming, and set out to make personal projects.

I also got the pleasure of speaking to various project managers who all gave a similar advice: You do not have to know how to code in order to enter the tech field. As a double major, I have thought about what careers I can purse if I were to lean more towards Marketing over MIS. I realized that before coming to this event, I had a very narrow vision of what it meant to work in tech. A tech company is similar to any regular company in the sense that roles and responsibilies are diverse and no two employees have the same skill sets. However, being able to understand aspects of tech, even when you are not directly involved in those specific responsibilities, and labeling yourself as a tech company employee can make you an attractive asset. The tech world requires people who can translate and communicate technical terminologies to others, whether it is for the purspose of cross-functional projects or to consumers. The reason why MIS is a major offered in the business school is for that sole purpose. 

This was my first ever school event and networking event and I am glad to say that I will be on the lookout for others in the future. The insight that I have gained is only fueling my desire to learn more. I encourage all students, specifically MIS students, to attend events like this in the future if they ever have doubts or questions about going into the tech field. Hearing from professionals who have gone through trial and error and made mistakes will alleviate all of your worries and you will definitely come out with a better understanding of yourself and your ambitions.
